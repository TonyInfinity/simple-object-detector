# simple-object-detector

This is a simple object detector app built using NodeJs, Express, Node Canvas, AWS S3 & AWS Rekcognition.

How it works: you upload an image, the image gets uploaded to a server, the server analyze the image, it sends back information about the image, the app uses that information to draws boxes and name tags around the appropriate objects in the image and send the final result to you.
